üìù **Test Case**

A test case is a set of conditions or steps that are performed to determine whether a software application or system meets the specified requirements and works as expected. It describes the inputs, actions, and expected results of a particular scenario. Test cases are often created based on the requirements and design specifications of the system, and can be automated or performed manually.

üîç **Why are test cases important?**
- Provide a structured approach to testing
- Help ensure that all necessary functionality has been tested
- Provide a record of what has been tested
- Make it easier to reproduce and fix any issues that are discovered
- Improve the quality and reliability of the software being tested

üõ†Ô∏è **How are test cases used?**
- Used during the testing phase of the software development life cycle
- Serve as a guide for testers to ensure that all relevant scenarios and edge cases have been tested
- Can be automated to reduce the time and effort required for testing
- Are updated as necessary to reflect changes in the requirements or design of the system


A typical test case consists of the following elements:

Test case ID: A unique identifier for the test case.
Test case name: A descriptive name for the test case.
Test case objective: A statement of the specific objective or goal of the test case.
Test case steps: A detailed description of the steps to be executed as part of the test case.
Test data requirements: Any specific test data or conditions required for the test case.
Expected results: The expected outcome of the test case.
Actual results: The actual outcome of the test case after it has been executed.
Pass/fail status: A determination of whether the test case passed or failed.
Test case author: The name or ID of the person who created the test case.
Test case reviewer: The name or ID of the person who reviewed and approved the test case.
Here is an example of a test case for a login page:
```
Test Case ID: TC001
Test Case Name: Login page functionality
Test Case Objective: To verify that the login page allows a user to login with valid credentials and displays an error message for invalid credentials.

Test Case Steps:
1. Launch the web application.
2. Navigate to the login page.
3. Enter a valid username and password.
4. Click on the login button.
5. Verify that the user is logged in and redirected to the home page.

Test Data Requirements:
- A valid username and password.

Expected Results:
- The user should be logged in and redirected to the home page.

Actual Results:
- The user was logged in and redirected to the home page.

Pass/Fail Status:
- Pass.

## Test Case Formats

There are several formats for writing test cases. Some of the most commonly used formats are:

- **Standard Test Case Format:** Includes fields such as Test Case ID, Test Case Description, Test Steps, Test Data, Expected Results, Actual Results, and Pass/Fail Status.

- **Action-Driven Test Case Format:** Based on keywords such as "login," "search," "add to cart," and "checkout." This format is useful for test automation.

- **BDD Test Case Format:** Uses a Given-When-Then structure to describe the scenario, action, and expected outcome of the test case.

- **Exploratory Test Case Format:** Documents the steps taken during exploratory testing. This format is more flexible than other formats, allowing testers to follow their instincts and explore the software.

Each format has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of format will depend on the specific testing needs of the project.
